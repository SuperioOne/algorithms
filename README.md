Rust implementations of various data structures and algorithms.

> If you're tempted to use this code for, some mad reasons, be aware that some of these implementations are more "educational examples" than production-ready solutions. 
For instance, merge sort algorithm is not exactly the most efficient implementation. And then there are the algorithms/data structures that are already implemented in 
Rust's standard library. So, use this code at your own risk!
